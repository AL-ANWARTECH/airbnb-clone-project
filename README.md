# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-focused application that simulates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. It provides a robust, scalable system for handling user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

This project is designed to deepen your knowledge of backend development, database design, API development, and software deployment practices in a real-world team environment.

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **Property Listings**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete properties.
- **Booking System**: Allow users to book and manage property reservations.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate payment features for handling transactions.
- **Review System**: Enable users to post and manage property reviews.
- **Data Optimization**: Implement indexing and caching for performance.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Django** – Python web framework for building the backend.
- **Django REST Framework** – For developing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database for data storage.
- **GraphQL** – For flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery** – Handles asynchronous tasks such as notifications and payments.
- **Redis** – Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker** – Containerization for development and deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions or similar tools for automated testing and deployment.
