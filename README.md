# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-focused application that simulates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. It provides a robust, scalable system for handling user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

This project is designed to deepen your knowledge of backend development, database design, API development, and software deployment practices in a real-world team environment.

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **Property Listings**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete properties.
- **Booking System**: Allow users to book and manage property reservations.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate payment features for handling transactions.
- **Review System**: Enable users to post and manage property reviews.
- **Data Optimization**: Implement indexing and caching for performance.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

Below is a breakdown of the technologies used in this project and their specific roles:

### 🔹 Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building and structuring the backend of the application. It handles routing, request processing, and business logic implementation.

### 🔹 Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension for Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, and standard HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 🔹 PostgreSQL
A robust, open-source relational database used to store all persistent data such as user details, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### 🔹 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST for specific use cases.

### 🔹 Celery
An asynchronous task queue used for running background tasks, such as sending confirmation emails, processing payments, or generating reports.

### 🔹 Redis
An in-memory data store used alongside Celery to manage task queues, and also as a caching layer to enhance performance and reduce database load.

### 🔹 Docker
A containerization platform that packages the project and its dependencies into isolated environments. This ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments.

### 🔹 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
A tool used to automate testing, linting, and deployment of the application whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project and how they contribute to the overall user experience and platform capabilities.

### 👤 User Management
This feature allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. It supports role-based interactions, enabling users to act as guests or hosts depending on their actions on the platform.

### 🏡 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. This feature ensures that all property data (descriptions, prices, availability, etc.) is maintained accurately, forming the backbone of the booking experience.

### 📆 Booking System
Users can browse available properties and make bookings with check-in and check-out dates. It handles the logic behind availability, overlapping dates, and booking confirmation to streamline the reservation process.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Secure payment processing is integrated to handle transactions associated with bookings. It ensures that users can pay for their stays safely, and that hosts receive proper financial tracking.

### ⭐ Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve booked. This feature builds trust and transparency, helping future guests make informed decisions and allowing hosts to improve their services.

### 🚀 API Documentation
The system includes comprehensive REST and GraphQL APIs documented using the OpenAPI standard. This ensures that frontend developers or third-party clients can easily integrate with the backend.

### ⚡ Data Optimization
To ensure performance and scalability, database indexing and caching strategies are implemented. This improves data retrieval times and minimizes the load on backend resources.

## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is critical for protecting user data, preventing abuse, and maintaining trust in the platform. The following key security measures will be implemented throughout the project:

### 🔑 Authentication
Users will be required to authenticate using secure methods such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only legitimate users can access the system, helping to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user data and operations.

### 🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to differentiate between guest and host permissions. For example, only hosts can create or edit property listings, while guests can book and review properties. This prevents users from performing actions outside their intended scope.

### ⏱️ Rate Limiting
To protect the API from abuse, rate limiting will restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a given timeframe. This helps prevent denial-of-service attacks and reduces the risk of brute-force login attempts.

### 🔒 Secure Communication
All data transmission between clients and the server will be encrypted using HTTPS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures that sensitive data such as login credentials and payment details are not exposed.

### 🧼 Input Validation and Sanitization
User inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. This measure enhances the overall robustness of the application.

### 🧾 Secure Payment Handling
Payment processing will be integrated with secure third-party services (e.g., Stripe) to handle sensitive financial data. This reduces liability and ensures compliance with financial regulations and PCI-DSS standards.

### 🔍 Logging and Monitoring
Security-related events will be logged and monitored to detect and respond to potential threats in real time. This includes failed login attempts, suspicious activity, and unexpected API usage patterns.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a set of practices that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. CI ensures that code changes are automatically tested and merged into the main branch, while CD handles the deployment of these changes to production or staging environments.

### Why is CI/CD Important?
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures faster and more reliable development cycles. It helps catch bugs early through automated testing, reduces manual errors during deployment, and accelerates the delivery of new features. For the Airbnb Clone project, this guarantees that every update is tested, consistent, and smoothly delivered to users.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Ensures the application runs in consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL Containers**: Used alongside Docker for isolated and repeatable database environments.
- **Celery + Redis**: For asynchronous task handling and message queuing as part of the deployment pipeline.
