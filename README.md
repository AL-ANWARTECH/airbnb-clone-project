# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-focused application that simulates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. It provides a robust, scalable system for handling user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

This project is designed to deepen your knowledge of backend development, database design, API development, and software deployment practices in a real-world team environment.

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **Property Listings**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete properties.
- **Booking System**: Allow users to book and manage property reservations.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate payment features for handling transactions.
- **Review System**: Enable users to post and manage property reviews.
- **Data Optimization**: Implement indexing and caching for performance.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

Below is a breakdown of the technologies used in this project and their specific roles:

### 🔹 Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building and structuring the backend of the application. It handles routing, request processing, and business logic implementation.

### 🔹 Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension for Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, and standard HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 🔹 PostgreSQL
A robust, open-source relational database used to store all persistent data such as user details, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### 🔹 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST for specific use cases.

### 🔹 Celery
An asynchronous task queue used for running background tasks, such as sending confirmation emails, processing payments, or generating reports.

### 🔹 Redis
An in-memory data store used alongside Celery to manage task queues, and also as a caching layer to enhance performance and reduce database load.

### 🔹 Docker
A containerization platform that packages the project and its dependencies into isolated environments. This ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments.

### 🔹 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
A tool used to automate testing, linting, and deployment of the application whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.
